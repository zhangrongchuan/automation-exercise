# Automation Exercise

This repository contains some example Python code from the [Simulation Software Engineering](https://simulation-software-engineering.github.io/homepage/) lecture. It is used for setting up automation workflows (CI) in GitHub and GitLab. For more information please check out the [exercise sheet](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/Lecture-Material/tree/main/05_testing_and_ci/automation_exercise.md). The code is a slightly modified version of the [code used in the Python testing exercise](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/testing-python-exercise-wt2425).

The code used in this exercise is based on [Chapter 7 of the book "Learning Scientific Programming with Python"](https://scipython.com/book/chapter-7-matplotlib/examples/the-two-dimensional-diffusion-equation/).
